Description:

Muvd is an application that allows users to search for movies, or suggests movies based on the user's mood. It then shows some basic information about the movie from The Movie Database, and if available, provides a link to a review of the movie from the New York Times.



Functionality: 

Upon navigating to the website, the user is presented with two different ways to find movies. First is a search bar where they can search for a movie by title. Second, the user can chose from four different moods in order to get movie suggestions that fit that mood.

If the user searches for a movie, they will be taken to a page that displays the titles of movies that most closely match their search. If they chose a mood, they will be given movie suggestions from a genre that corresponds to that mood. Next and previous buttons at the bottom of the page let the user navigate between pages of movie results.

Clicking on one of the movies will display its tagline, a poster, a brief overview, the release date, and the run time.  If there is a review of the movie from the New York Times, it will display a link to the review as well as a brief synopsis of the review and wether or not the movie is a NYT's critic's choice.
